# Pathogens & Planetary Change

This code is used to generate the figures for the review on biodiversity, climate & planetary change, and infectious disease, citation to come. 

## For Users

The code herein uses IUCN data, which takes the form of a large shapefile. Due to its size it can't be stored on GitHub, so it's currently stored on Google Drive. There's a file `src/iucn-download.R` that you should run to download that data. 

All other data are provided, and the sources are noted in the subfolder `README.md` files.

## Accompanying information 

This document contains a brief run-down of all the analysis-related figures in the main text of the pathogens & planetary change manuscript referenced in the root README. 

### Figure 1 

Figure 1 is the figure involving the most data generated in other publications. For details on how it was created, see `./data/recreation/README.md` or Text S2 in the main text of the manuscript.
