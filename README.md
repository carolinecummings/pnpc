# Pathogens & Planetary Change

This code is used to generate the figures for the review on biodiversity, climate & planetary change, and infectious disease, citation to come. 

## For Users

The code herein uses IUCN data, which takes the form of a large shapefile. Due to its size it can't be stored on GitHub, so it's currently stored on Google Drive. There's a file `src/iucn-download.R` that you should run to download that data. 

In a related fashion, we use data from the [Clover Project](https://github.com/viralemergence/clover) which is downloaded in the `src/clover-download.R` file. The data are stored in this repository as flat files, but it's worth noting where they came from.
