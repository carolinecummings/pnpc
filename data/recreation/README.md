# Data for Plot Recreations

In our paper, we use data from three published studies to recreate three "hockey-stick" style plots as well as a map of richness and emergence (Fig 1 in the manuscript). The data can be found in this folder.

While also cited in the manuscript, the data from Ceballos et al. (2015) can be found [here](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1400253) in the Supplementary Information and in Figure 1. We extracted the values for these data directly from the plot. For our data on spillover from Meadows et al. (2023), those data are found in this [handy repository](https://github.com/concentricbyginkgo/zoonotic_spillover_trend). Last, the data from the PAGES 2k Consortium was downloaded from this [Figshare database](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Reconstruction_ensemble_median_and_95_range/8143094), though more extensive versions of the data can be found [here](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/paleo-search/study/21171). 

Though not used in exactly the same way, the hotspots data from Allen et al. (2017) can be found [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-00923-8).

The data from the Emerging Infectious Disease Repository (EIDR) was pulled from [their dashboard](https://eidr.ecohealthalliance.org/event-map).
