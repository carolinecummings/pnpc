In June, the patient’s catheter exit site became infected with a strain of S. aureus resistant to vancomycin and oxacillin.

The patient's earlier vancomycin therapy likely contributed to the emergence of this drug resistance in his S. aureus infection. This represents the emergence of a drug resistance in a new location.

In the summer of 1974 the patient developed pemphigoid and was treated with cyclophosphamide.  By mid-September, 1974, the patient’s clinical condition improved dramatically, but on October 5 the patient began to experience severe gastrointestinal illness.  After 3 weeks of severe watery diarrhea, cyclophosphamide therapy was terminated and the patient recovered after 2 weeks.  C. parvum was identified through jejunal biopsies and was determined to be the source of gastrointestinal illness.  The significant cyclophosphamide therapy caused immunosuppression and allowed for opportunistic infection by C. parvum.  The main reservoirs of C. parvum appear to be rats and cattle.  Cryptosporidium are typically transmitted through the consumption of contaminated food or water.

Prior to 1988, extensive drug resistance had been reported within Thailand in P. falciparum infections, including resistance to chloroquine, quinine, and combination sulfadoxine and pryimethamine (S/P). Despite these noted resistances, mefloquine therapy maintained generally high efficacy rates. The specific definition of MDR resistance for malaria requires resistance to more than two chemically different antimalarial compounds (Wernsdorfer et al. 1994). Chloroquine and quinine are chemically related, so prior to 1988, official MDR malaria had been rare in Thailand. In 1988, mining and logging work in Cambodia drew thousands of Thai workers to Pailin, Cambodia, a region of high P. falciparum prevalence. Over the next three year Thai workers frequently returned home through the border town of Bo Rai. Most workers had low immunity to P. falciparum malaria prior to their exposure in Cambodia, and over half came to Bo Rai positive for P. falciparum malaria. It was impossible for Bo Rai to properly treat the massive, infected workforce. Mefloquine therapy was administered broadly, and without proper regulation. By 1989, mefloquine efficacy dropped sharply, and MDR P. falciparum became established in Thailand. The pressures of war contributing to this development in a two ways. Firstly, the war forced thousands of refugees from Mynamar to Bo Rai. These refugees could not readily obtain medical care if infected by P. falciparum. Secondly, the war forced workers to congregate on designated roads that had been cleared of landmines, creating prime conditions for the congregation of mosquitoes, which resulted in high levels of malaria transmission. Breakdowns in public health measures, such as inadequate treatment, and preventative measures, also contributed to the emergence of this drug resistance.
